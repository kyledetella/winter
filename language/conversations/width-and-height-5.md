< We need to get some measurements to get started. What is the width and height of your artwork?
* request_artwork_size/width_and_height

Its [8 inches](artwork_size#width) wide
* provide_artwork_size/width

< Ok, and what is the height (in inches)?
* request_artwork_size/height

I think [14](artwork_size#height)
* provide_artwork_size/height
